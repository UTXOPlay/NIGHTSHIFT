# Release verification

The active release is [NIGHTSHIFT 8.0 Combat Season](nightshift-v8.md). Its application profile is `dc78757f7fd0b708a46d9549e6843986a668a334ad10f65a5ee7a43934b4ee53`. The current source and browser hashes are in `release-integrity.json`; the preserved V7 manifest is `release-integrity-v7.json`.

## Preserved V7 release

The extracted game is NIGHTSHIFT 7.0 World Circuit, deployed to UTXOPlay on 2026-10-27. The repository packaging work is dated 2026-10-28.

Its native application profile is `1123347a8d1e2ef1226bd922221dc0727286486890b2b9997c82e22505b6cd97`. The original deployed native binary SHA-256 is `92ba7769c907a82ca8f2fd15940034544e900f39c03909f2ca6883a1773eb7ba`. A rebuild on a different machine can have a different binary hash; the application profile and replay result must agree.

`release-integrity-v7.json` records the hashes of the three native profile-bound source files and 31 audited browser files. `npm run check:release` verifies them after building. Changing packaging or documentation does not change the racing rules. Native V6 and V7 reject each other's signed exports; older careers must stay with their matching verifier and data namespace.

## Recorded deployed-release checks

- 15 JavaScript/host/scheduler tests and two Rust tests, with Clippy warnings denied.
- 38 native/browser tapes, 297,805 active ticks and 1,116 career frames, including successful runs for all twelve events and an earned career that buys all six cars.
- Signed purchases, race rewards, export verification, restart recovery, stale-action rejection and tampered-purchase rejection.
- Thirteen staging and public browser acceptance checks covering 1920×1080, 2560×1080, 2560×1440, 3840×2160, 844×390 and the 390×844 rotation gate. Inverse pointer mapping, capped backing resolution, simultaneous joystick/defense input, separated results, earned purchases and next-stage flow are included.
- Seven local and public combat checks covering collisions, incoming hits, successful defense, outgoing hits, rival disable, fatal rollover and reduced motion. The death tick stays frozen while the car animates and results appear. Each scenario replays through the native host.
- Twelve map previews and thumbnails, six minimap actors, follow/full-course toggling and mobile HUD overlap checks.
- The final 30-second public 1920×1080 Chromium sample measured 60 median FPS / 59 p10, 2.94 ms median CPU draw work, render scale 1 and no browser errors. It advanced 30.03 simulated seconds in 30.03 wall seconds. These are desktop measurements, not a promise of equivalent performance on every device.
- A separate public startup sample measured 12.88 seconds cold and 1.52 seconds warm. Another network-sensitive cold run took 32.17 seconds. Physical Android/iOS hardware was not tested.

Local verification commands and GitHub Actions reproduce the code-level checks. Browser tools create fresh test careers; they do not use production player identities or stored private keys. Large original deployment evidence and runtime data are intentionally not committed.

## Scope

This is a solo game with AI opponents. Live multiplayer requires authoritative match timing, actor admission, ordered inputs, reconciliation, disconnect handling and exactly-once match rewards. Myelin verifies off-chain host replay; the game does not settle races or currency on CKB.
